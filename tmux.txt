$ tmux This is a tmux “session,”
$ exit   closes tmux and returns back to the standard
terminal

tmux new -s basic
e can fire it up, start up programs
or processes inside the tmux environment, and then leave it running in the
background by “detaching” from the session.

when we detach from a tmux session, we’re
not actually closing tmux. Any programs we started up in that session will
stay running. We can then “attach” to the session and pick up where we left
off.

can now detach from the
tmux session by pressing C TRL - b followed by d . This returns us to our regular
terminal prompt

C TRL - b
We have to prefix each tmux command with this key com-
bination

close your terminal window.
but the tmux session is still chugging
along, along with the top application we launched.
tmux ls

tmux attach

Let’s detach from the basic session
with P REFIX d

create a new tmux instance
tmux new -s second_session -d

$ tmux ls    lists session names

We can attach to the session we want by using the -t flag:
$ tmux attach -t second_session

We can type exit within a session to destroy the session, but we can also kill
off sessions with the kill-session command.
$ tmux kill-session -t basic
$ tmux kill-session -t second_session






========== cheat sheet ================

$ tmux ls   # list running tmux sessions
$ exit      # close tmux session

Sharing sessions between terminals:
$ tmux new -s session_name
$ tmux at -t session_name  # attach
$ tmux kill-session -t session_name

tmux ls
